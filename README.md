# Module Overview

In the digital era, we are bombarded by humongous streams of
information. Sometimes, these 'inputs' are not interesting enough to
breach the defensive barriers that protect our attention ― hence, we
simply decide to pass over. Other times, what we are exposed to seems
valuable but we do not see any neat, meaningful pattern in it (that's
the bottom line as it comes to crunch massive datasets!!). According to
the popular idiom *"one picture is worth a thousand words"*, all what
messengers and audiences need to 'click' is ― often-times ― just a
simple, effective visualization.

This module is a journey into the art and science of creating memorable
charts, which grab the attention of the audience and successfully convey
insights and narratives. Pleasant journeys require good companions:
'infographic' ― i.e., the field that investigates the representation of
information, data, and knowledge ― will offer the theoretical platform
for the module; Python will make things happen (at least on our screen).
Consistently with the teaching philosophy of the module leader, each
individual lecture integrates 'theory' and 'practice'.

# Materials & Readings

Mandatory materials/readings will be circulated via Moodle in advance
(every Friday – i.e., one week before the class). For this module you are not required to purchase any expensive
book, whereas it is essential you carefully go through:

-   lecture notes (to be uploaded onto
    Moodle/[Github](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635) weekly; they include slideshows + videos);
-   case studies (to be uploaded onto
    Moodle/[Github](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/caseStudies/)
    weekly);
-   Python scripts/Jupyter notebooks (to be uploaded onto
    Moodle/[Github](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/tutorials/)
    or `week*` directories weekly);
-   journal articles (to be uploaded onto
    Moodle/[Github](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/references/)
    weekly).

Discretionary readings/materials students may want to reference to are:

-   [Knowledge is
    Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/2014/knowledge-is-beautiful/)

-   [The Functional
    Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/about-book.html)

-   [The Information Capital](http://theinformationcapital.com/)

-   [The Visual Display of Quantitative
    Information](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1537986137&sr=8-3&keywords=edward+tufte).

# Learning Objectives

At the end of the module, students should be able to:

-   generate and evaluate visual forms for appropriateness, context, and
    meaning;

-   design and execute statical charts with a particular emphasis on
    massive datasets;

-   design and execute complex visualizations involving timeliness and
    geospatial attributes;

-   design and execute interactive visualizations;

-   leverage the visualization capabilities of the Python libraries
    [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and
    [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/).

# Assessment

As per the module specification, students will be assessed on the basis
of coursework submissions, which all are the outcome of group-level
efforts (yes, you understand correctly, for this module there is no
final examination and you are not supposed to deliver any assignment on
your own). Specifically, there are three pieces of coursework, namely:

+   a 'mid-term project' (MTP)
+   a 'final course project' (FCP)
+   two case studies (CS)

All types of assessment will be evaluated along four criteria: i)
appropriate use of notions and frameworks discussed in class; ii)
effectiveness of the proposed answer or solution; iii)
originality/creativity of the proposed answer or solution; iv)
organization an clarity of submitted materials. All criteria carry-out
equal weight in terms of mark.

## Mid-term project

For the **MTP**, students are required to solve a complex
visualization problem. The details of the MTP will be available by week 3, when the
project will be released. Submissions will be assessed on a
0 - 100% scale. The Groups who fail MTP can resubmit a revised version
of the project; if the revision is sufficient, students receive a 50%
mark. The deadline for the project is November 9 (week 6). Selected groups will be invited to present the outcome of
their work to fellow students in week 6. Invited groups could also receive a
maximum of 3 bonus points on the basis of the quality of their presentations.

## Final course project

With the **FCP** , groups
make their hands 'dirty' as they help a real-world client to face some
data visualization challenges. Details about the client and the
challenge will be available in week 7. Final course projects will be
evaluated on a rolling-based window and should be submitted by mid December
(the course office will confirm the exact deadline shortly).

## Case studies

Case studies provide students with the opportunity to learn how to integrate
the 'business' and the 'data viz' perspectives in order to  deal
effectively with real-world problems. In terms of process, groups of students
will receive i) a detailed description of a business issue, and ii) relevant
data; then, they will be working for one week to produce their own solution.
Solutions will be disclussed in class. Each presenting group will be
associated with a discussant group whose role is to challenge the ideas,
tools, and recommendetions that will be brought to the table. I expect six
pairs of presenting and discussant groups; this means group that will present
their solution in week 8 will serve as discussant in week 10 (and viceversa).
Both presenting and discussant groups will be assessed.

## Discretionary coursework

**Problem sets** will be launched weekly. Individual students may want to deal
these problem sets and present their solution to the class. A maximum of three
students per session will be selected on the basis of the novelty and
effectiveness of the proposed solution. One bonus point (+1 FM) will be
assigned.

# Guest speakers

Throughout all the various weeks of the Term, SMM635 will host two types of
guest speakers: ambassadors – former students of the BA program – and
practitioners from several industries.

# Prerequisites

The SMM692 ― Python Pre-Course module defines the knowledge students
should possess in order to proficiently attend to SMM635 ― Data
Visualization.

# Software requirements

For this module you are supposed to run Python 3.7 or higher on your machine. Now,
how to get Python work on your machine? There are several ways to do
that. A fast, smooth alternative is to install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/), an open source
distribution of Python that includes: i) 250+ popular data science
packages; ii) the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) package,
which makes quick and easy to install, run, and upgrade complex data
science and machine learning environments.

Here is the workflow:

1.  Use your preferred browser to open the link pointing to the
    [Anaconda repository](http://www.numpy.org/);

2.  Select the installer the which suits your machine (32- or 64-bit)
    and operating system (Win, Mac OS, Linux). Mac users may want to
    download the graphical installer rather than the command-line
    installer (students may feel less comfortable with);

3.  Retrieve the installer (perhaps in your download folder);

4.  Run the installer;

5.  Log-out from your current session (it does not matter if you use
    Win, Mac OS or Linux);

6.  Log-in into a new session;

7.  Run 'Anaconda Navigator'―namely, a convenient place to launch the
    IPython shell or other user-interfaces to interact with IPython.

On top of Anaconda/Python, students should install the modules
[Matplotlib](https://networkx.github.io/),
[Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/),
[Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/manual.html),
[Pyshp](https://glenbambrick.com/tag/pyshp/),
[Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) (I
recommend doing that with Conda).
